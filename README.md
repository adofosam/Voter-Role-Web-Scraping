# Voter-Role-Web-Scraping
I was approached and asked to make a take a dataset of voter information and determine which voters in the dataset were a part of RI House District 30 and RI Senate Districts 35.

I decided to use Python to perform the webscraping to gather the data and R to clean the data. I understand all the work could be done through Python, but I enjoy working with R's dataframe capabilities better.

The order or the analysis is:
1) RI_Voters.md (R)
2) Rep_Voter_Bot.md (Py)
3) RI_House_30_Voters.md (R)
4) RI_Senate_35_Voters.md (R)
