# Voter-Role-Web-Scraping
I was approached and asked to make a take a dataset of voter information and determine which voters in the dataset were a part of RI House District 30 and RI Senate Districts 35.

I decided to use Python to perform the webscraping to gather the data and R to clean the data.
